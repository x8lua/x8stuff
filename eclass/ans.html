              The Cultural Affairs Bureau (IC) President, Deland Leong Wai Man, announced yesterday that her office will add 20 new items to Macau’s Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage, bringing the total to 90. These items include various traditions such as Cantonese music, Patuá songs and the craft of making Pork Chop Buns.



Pork Chop Buns are often praised by food critics and chefs as a perfect example of Macau cuisine. This snack combines Portuguese and Chinese flavours to create a unique taste. Tour guides say that any visitor who loves food should try Pork Chop Buns, as well as Egg Tarts, Almond Biscuits and Beef Offal.



Leong did not specify when the full list of the new items will be officially published. She did explain, however, that Patuá is a Portuguese-Asian Creole language spoken by Macau’s mixed heritage community and its diaspora, and is now highly endangered. Leong made these remarks at a press briefing following a closed meeting of the Cultural Heritage Council at the Macau Cultural Centre in Nape.



Before this announcement, the inventory held 70 items, including Almond Biscuits, Egg Tarts (called “Custard Tarts” in English) and Traditional Chinese Wedding Cakes. Councillor and civil engineer Wu Chou Kit said that all council members had approved the new items because they fit well with the existing heritage list and reflect a broad cultural range.



Leong also updated reporters on the restoration of the statues at the Ruins of St. Paul’s. She said that work on all the statues has been delayed until early next year. Two right-side statues in the second row have already been cleaned and maintained. However, experts found cracks in the two left-side statues and will study whether these flaws are due to original casting problems or later damage. The Macau Palace Museum’s Cultural Heritage Preservation and Transmission Centre will lead this research and create a detailed restoration plan.



Leong emphasised that the restoration follows strict scientific methods and includes technical exchanges and academic research. She denied rumours that the restored bronze statues had been misplaced when reinstalled. Councillors agreed to postpone the project to allow for careful expert assessment.



When asked if the Cultural Heritage Protection Law might change to ease building restrictions, Leong replied that buffer-zone rules focus only on building height and size, not on façade works. She stressed that as long as renovations do not harm heritage sites, no extra approval is needed. This targeted approach, she said, balances heritage protection with business and public convenience.

The Macau Cultural Affairs Bureau (IC) announced in a statement yesterday that ticket refunds are now available for the Peking opera performance “A Meeting of Heroes: Invoking the East Wind.” The show, which was due to take place last night, was cancelled because of adjustments in the overall programme. Audience members who bought tickets can start requesting refunds from today.



This performance was scheduled at the Grand Auditorium of the Macau Cultural Centre as part of the “1st Chinese Culture Performances Season.” The season was designed to showcase traditional art forms and celebrate classic Chinese opera, but recent changes in scheduling meant this production had to be removed from the line-up.



Attendees who purchased tickets through the Enjoy Macao Ticketing online platform will receive automatic refunds. The bureau indicated that payments for these online orders will be returned directly to the original account used during purchase. Customers do not need to take any further action if they booked their seats via the official website.



For those who bought tickets in person at an Enjoy Macao Ticketing outlet, refunds can be obtained by visiting any ticket office before December 14. Audience members should present the intact tickets along with proof of purchase. After this deadline, refunds will no longer be processed at ticketing outlets.



Anyone with questions or concerns about the refund process can contact the Cultural Affairs Bureau by phone at 2840 0555. Bureau staff stressed that they aim to make the refund procedure as smooth and efficient as possible. They regretted any inconvenience caused by the last-minute cancellation and expressed their commitment to serving the public.



As part of its commitment to high-quality customer service, the IC emphasised that full refunds reflect their respect for ticket holders. The bureau apologised for any disappointment and assured patrons of its dedication to presenting cultural events without disruption. It is hoped that this clear refund policy will maintain trust and encourage future attendance at performances in Macau.



The bureau also invited the audience to explore other events in the season, promising upcoming performances that feature dance, music and theatre from various regions of China. They encouraged ticket holders to check the official website for updated schedules and news about future shows, hoping visitors will continue to support the arts and cultural activities in Macau.

Former cabinet minister Lord Michael Gove has apologised on behalf of the government and the Conservative Party for errors made during the coronavirus pandemic. He was responding to a report by Baroness Hallett, who described the culture in No 10 as “toxic and chaotic” under Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Gove admitted that some attitudes in Downing Street were far from ideal but argued that in a severe crisis, government work cannot unfold like scenes from a Jane Austen novel.



The 800-page inquiry concluded that instituting a lockdown just one week earlier in the first wave might have saved around 23,000 lives in England, although it would not have changed the total number of deaths. It also suggested that earlier social-distancing measures could have averted lockdowns altogether. The report blamed the four UK administrations—England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales—for failing to act swiftly. February 2020 was termed a “lost month,” and the report said the government’s lack of urgency was inexcusable.



Baroness Hallett criticised the delay in autumn 2020 and the government’s refusal to introduce restrictions until infection levels became critical over Christmas. She accused Johnson of hesitating on major decisions and repeatedly changing his mind. Lord Gove rejected the idea that these findings would end Johnson’s future political ambitions. He defended Johnson’s vaccine drive, noting that without his determination, Britain would not have been the first country to start mass vaccinations.



The inquiry singled out Dominic Cummings, a senior Downing Street aide, for fostering a climate of fear with his destabilising behaviour. Cummings responded by accusing the report of rewriting history and argued that many experts were wrong in the early months of the pandemic. Gove countered that Cummings had played a key role in ensuring data was thoroughly examined and in establishing measures to control the virus.



Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak said decisions had been made amid great uncertainty, and he stressed the need to learn lessons for the future. Baroness Hallett also criticised Sir Chris Wormald—then permanent secretary at the health department—for failing to correct overly optimistic statements by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Science Secretary Liz Kendall defended Wormald, saying he was doing excellent work and learning from the pandemic experience.



Q1: What is the main focus of the revised passage?



A



Apologies and criticisms related to the government's pandemic response

B



Scientific debates over early Covid treatments

C



The personal careers of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove

D



The success of the UK's vaccine rollout

Q2: According to the report, how many lives could have been saved by starting the first lockdown one week earlier?



A



50,000

B



23,000

C



15,000

D



10,000

Q3: In this context, what does the word “inexcusable” most likely mean?



A



Cheaply affordable

B



Easily forgotten

C



Impossible to accept

D



Completely understandableQ4: Why does the passage include comments from figures such as Rishi Sunak and Liz Kendall?



A



To show differing viewpoints on learning lessons from the pandemic

B



To detail budgetary concerns unrelated to health

C



To praise Boris Johnson’s leadership style

D



To argue against future vaccine programmesQ5: What can be inferred about the government’s actions in autumn 2020?



A



They waited until infection levels were critical before imposing measures.

B



They avoided any delay by preparing months in advance.

C



They coordinated perfectly with health experts.

D



They acted too quickly and imposed unnecessary rules.
